# Flutter Demo app

## Hints
 - `flutter create my_app` - create a new app
 - `flutter run` - run an app on a device
 - `flutter run -d <deviceId>` - run an app on a specific device
 - `flutter run -d all` - run an app on all active simulators
 - `flutter devices` - see a list of connected devices
 - `flutter emulators` - see a list of available devices
 - `flutter emulators --launch <name_of_emulator>` - run an emulator
 - `flutter clean` - clear command will delete the build tools and dart directories in flutter project so when we re-compile the project it will start from the beginning
